# TwoWire Simulator

I have been working on a project in which I worked with several I2C sensors that gave me information. However, for testing purposes I wrote this extension of the library “Wire.h” to let me simulate with an Arduino the behaviour of several I2C devices.

## Requirements
- Wire.h library (from arduino's official repository)
